Description: In this project we explored the ability to identify dog breeds from a single picture through the understanding of machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can identify the breed of a dog when given an image. There are 120 breeds, and a relatively small number of training images per class, which makes the problem harder than it originally seems.

Engineering: We Extracted and Loaded data sets from Kaggle and worked on where to get started. After initial cleaning of the raw files, we used CoLab to house the machine learning using Spark. This project required us to use Pandas, SKlearn, cv2, os, Numpy, Tenser flow, Keras, and Matplotlib.

Methodology
Some mid project struggles were that we were able to get images and predictions produced but not quite correct at first. We then regrouped and 

Results
The model performed reasonably well, achieving ~80% accuracy on the validation set.
